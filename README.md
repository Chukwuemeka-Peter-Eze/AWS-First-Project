# AWS-First-Project
My first AWS + DevOps project: a static portfolio site hosted on Amazon S3, provisioned with Terraform, and deployed via GitHub Actions. Showcases Git, GitHub, IaC, and CI/CD, the foundation of my Cloud and DevOps journey.

Welcome to my first AWS + DevOps project.
This repository demonstrates how I combined Git, GitHub, Terraform, AWS S3, and GitHub Actions to build and deploy a simple static portfolio site.

Hosting: Static website hosted on Amazon S3
Infrastructure as Code: Managed with Terraform
CI/CD: Automated deployment using GitHub Actions
Version Control: Fully tracked and managed via Git and GitHub

This project marks the beginning of my Cloud and DevOps journey, where Iâ€™ll be building, automating, and showcasing real-world projects that strengthen my skills in AWS, DevOps, and infrastructure automation.
